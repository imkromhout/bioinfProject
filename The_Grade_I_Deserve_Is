After a long consultation with myself,
in which I considered the following things..

I asked for help when I needed it, 
from co-students and teachers and was also willing to help others.
I understand why GitHub is used and learned what the benefits of GitHub are for me.
During this day I discovered and tested several features of GitHub,
including collaboration with others, pull request and creating repositories.
I did not only create a Test repository for today,
but also for two upcoming projects:
- Bioinformatics project (https://github.com/imkromhout/bioinfProject)
  bioinfProject/bioinfProject.png 
- Personal project Red queen hypothesis (https://github.com/imkromhout/redqueen)
I also learned how to fork.

..I came to the conclusion that I deserve an eight.
